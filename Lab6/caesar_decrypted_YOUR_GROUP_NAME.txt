9,20.2597876003,IN ANOTHER MOMENT DOWN WENT ALICE AFTER IT  NEVER ONCE CONSIDERING HOW IN THE WORLD SHE WAS TO GET OUT AGAIN 

14,18.6748897153, THE RABBIT HOLE WENT STRAIGHT ON LIKE A TUNNEL FOR SOME WAY  AND THEN DIPPED SUDDENLY DOWN  SO SUDDENLY THAT ALICE HAD NOT A MOMENT TO THINK ABOUT STOPPING HERSELF BEFORE SHE FOUND HERSELF FALLING DOWN A VERY DEEP WELL 

11,38.7244121576, EITHER THE WELL WAS VERY DEEP  OR SHE FELL VERY SLOWLY  FOR SHE HAD PLENTY OF TIME AS SHE WENT DOWN TO LOOK ABOUT HER AND TO WONDER WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT  FIRST  SHE TRIED TO LOOK DOWN AND MAKE OUT WHAT SHE WAS COMING TO  BUT IT WAS TOO DARK TO SEE ANYTHING  THEN SHE LOOKED AT THE SIDES OF THE WELL  AND NOTICED THAT THEY WERE FILLED WITH CUPBOARDS AND BOOK SHELVES  HERE AND THERE SHE SAW MAPS AND PICTURES HUNG UPON PEGS  SHE TOOK DOWN A JAR FROM ONE OF THE SHELVES AS SHE PASSED  IT WAS LABELLED  ORANGE MARMALADE   BUT TO HER GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT IT WAS EMPTY  SHE DID NOT LIKE TO DROP THE JAR FOR FEAR OF KILLING SOMEBODY  SO MANAGED TO PUT IT INTO ONE OF THE CUPBOARDS AS SHE FELL PAST IT 

20,43.3916030878, WELL   THOUGHT ALICE TO HERSELF   AFTER SUCH A FALL AS THIS  I SHALL THINK NOTHING OF TUMBLING DOWN STAIRS  HOW BRAVE THEY LL ALL THINK ME AT HOME  WHY  I WOULDN T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT  EVEN IF I FELL OFF THE TOP OF THE HOUSE    WHICH WAS VERY LIKELY TRUE
